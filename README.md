## Creating Your Character

To start your D&D adventure, you'll need to create a character. Here's how to generate your character's abilities and hit points:

### Ability Scores

Each character has six abilities:

* **Strength:** Measures physical power
* **Dexterity:** Measures agility and coordination
* **Constitution:** Measures health and stamina
* **Intelligence:** Measures reasoning and knowledge
* **Wisdom:** Measures perception and insight
* **Charisma:** Measures personality and charm

**Determining Ability Scores:**

1. **Roll four 6-sided dice.**
2. **Discard the lowest die.**
3. **Add the remaining three dice together.**
4. **Repeat this process six times,** once for each ability.

**Example:**

Let's say your dice rolls look like this:

* **Strength:** 5, 3, 1, 6  (Discard the 1, sum is 14)
* **Dexterity:** 3, 2, 5, 3  (Discard the 2, sum is 11)
* **Constitution:** 1, 1, 1, 1  (Discard the 1, sum is 3)
* **Intelligence:** 2, 1, 6, 6  (Discard the 1, sum is 14)
* **Wisdom:** 3, 5, 3, 4  (Discard the 3, sum is 12)
* **Charisma:** 6, 6, 6, 6  (Discard the 6, sum is 18)

### Hit Points

Your character's hit points represent their ability to withstand damage.

**Calculating Hit Points:**

1. **Constitution Modifier:** 
   * Subtract 10 from your Constitution score.
   * Divide the result by 2.
   * Round down to the nearest whole number.
2. **Hit Points:** 10 + your Constitution modifier.

**Example:**

If your Constitution score is 3:

* Constitution modifier = (3 - 10) / 2 = -3.5, rounded down to -4
* Hit points = 10 + (-4) = 6
